## The colors used are the following:

- header bg color: #d94e44 - this appears only in the header;

- the other red-ish color: #db4d3f;

- navigation separator color: #d6d4d4 - the grey lines;

- body bg color: #f9f9f9;

- form sections bg color: #f6f4f4;

## Font awesome icons used:

- fa-info for "About" section of the form;

- fa-list for "Ingredients" section of the form;

- fa-plus-square for add ingredient;

- fa-list-ol for "Steps" section of the form;

- fa-trash-o for "Cancel" button;

- fa-floppy-o for "Save recipe" button;

* Max width of the form should be 1000px and the header (including navigation) should be liquid (expand as needed).

* Navigation sections should be equal and navigation controls should be centered both horizontally and vertically.

* When the width permits there is an "of" between "Unit" and "Ingredient", in the "Ingredients" section ;)

* Put all files into one archive. Name the archive using the following pattern: your-name-css-cookbook-homework
